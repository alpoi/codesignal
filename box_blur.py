# The pixels in the input image are represented as integers. 
# The algorithm distorts the input image in the following way: 
# Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the 
# average value of the pixel values from the 3 Ã— 3 square that 
# has its center at x, including x itself. All the pixels on 
# the border of x are then removed. Return the blurred image 
# as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.
